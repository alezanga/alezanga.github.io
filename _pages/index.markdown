# Alessandro Zangari - Ph.D. research page

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice (Italy). Previously, I obtained
a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Padua in 2020, focusing on the AI track.

- Supervisor: Prof. [Andrea Albarelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y_zlfmoAAAAJ)

## Research

My main research interests are Explainable AI, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. 

My Ph.D. project
focuses on developing new scalable and explainable strategies for Machine Learning, with the goal of bridging the gap
between the performance of machine learning methods and the intelligibility of their reasoning.

I am also part of the project [Interconnected
Nord-Est Innovation Ecosystem](https://pric.unive.it/progetti/spoke-6-inest/home){:target="_blank"}, where I work on
industrial applications of my research to the tourism domain.
