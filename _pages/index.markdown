Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice (Italy). Previously, I obtained
a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Padua in 2020, with a focus on AI and Machine Learning.
During my Master's thesis, I developed [DataMole](https://github.com/alezanga/dataMole){:target="_blank"}, a GUI-based
program to clean, analyze and preprocess longitudinal datasets.

## About me

## Research

My main research interests are Explainable AI (XAI) and Natural Language Processing, but I am also working on XAI
solutions for Computer Vision.

My Ph.D. project
focuses on developing new scalable and explainable strategies for Machine Learning, with the goal of bridging the gap
between the performance of machine learning methods and the intelligibility of their reasoning.

I am also part of the project [Interconnected
Nord-Est Innovation Ecosystem](https://pric.unive.it/progetti/spoke-6-inest/home){:target="_blank"}, where I work on
textual data analytics to model tourist behaviour.
